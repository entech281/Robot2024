# Java Code for CHARGED UP written off-season to experiment with swerve drive and hopefully compete with new robot in Fall 2023

See [the online changelog](https://github.com/FRC2495/FRC2495-2023-Swerve/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for information about updates since this project was created.

## Description

A project to experiment switching our drivetrain from tank drive to swerve.

The drivetrain is composed of four MK4i Swerve Modules, each configured with two SPARKS MAX, a NEO as the driving motor, a NEO as the turning motor, and a Thrifty encoder as the absolute turning encoder.

## Prerequisites

* SPARK MAX Firmware v1.6.2 - Adds features that are required for swerve
* REVLib v2023.1.2 - Includes APIs for the new firmware features
